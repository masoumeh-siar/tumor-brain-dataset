# Brain tumor dataset

The images are in two folders: normal (0) and tumor (1).
The number of normal images is 1121, and the number of tumor images is 811.

The author of the paper collects all these images. Any use of this dataset that results in an academic publication or other publication, which includes a bibliography, should consist of a citation to our paper.
